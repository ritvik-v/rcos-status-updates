## Last Week's Accomplishments

Streamlined some code within the script itself - made it so that the script stores commits as entries in a dictionary so that it can be further processed from there.

## This Week's Plan

More of the curriculum specification has been developed - this week I plan to learn about using Git submodules to further improve how we organize our projects and convey information about each stage change between the student and the instructor.

## Anything Blocking?

Don't have experience using GitPython - will need to work on that.
