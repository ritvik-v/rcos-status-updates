## Last Week's Accomplishments

Started work on a basic curriculum, moving students from implementing their first "Hello, World!" program to working with more advanced Python concepts. Created various stages that a student will progress through, completing increasingly difficult tasks until creating something of their own.

## This Week's Plan

Figuring out how to work with the Atom plugin team to "flash" the next stage on top of the student's existing code. We want to advance the student to the next stage, while preserving their work and not breaking anything.

## Anything Blocking?

We need to work on ways to either ensure the student cannot add code in unexpected places, or identify when the student has made a change that would not be consistent with code provided in the next stage, i.e., shared variable names, etc.
