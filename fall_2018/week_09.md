## Last Week's Accomplishments

Spent some time playing around with Git submodules - it still hasn't been determined if submodules are something that we wish to utilize, but submodules can allow for code to easily be added to various different features that a student decides to implement on a project, and keep those commits separate. In the meantime, I modified the script so that an output of changes made to a single file can be viewed chronologically. 

## This Week's Plan

In addition to further researching Gitmodules, I'd like to see if there's a way I can implement making some educated guesses about what kind of changes have been made to a file based on diffs - don't yet know how I would implement this outside of a large number of if statements.

## Anything Blocking?
