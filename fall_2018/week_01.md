## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Narrowed down and compartmentalized aspects of the overall project into smaller committees. Learned about the overall scope and vision for the project - what we expect it to look like as a finished product, what we can anticipate at the end of this semester.

> Met as part of the backend committee - discussed potential technologies for us to utilize, whether to go serverless or not, how to represent students' work and commits.

## This Week's Plan

> Research into how Git stores changes between commits, and whether we might implement Git's solution or develop our own way to hash commits, and store them.

## Anything Blocking?
