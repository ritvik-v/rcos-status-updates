## Last Week's Accomplishments

Created a curriculum utility script in Python - will be used to help generate instructions for students to progress from one stage to another. Currently takes all git log files in .txt format from a specified directory and outputs to the command line.

## This Week's Plan

Potentially allow the script to detect files that are not git logs? Also work on making output a more usable format than just the command line.

## Anything Blocking?
