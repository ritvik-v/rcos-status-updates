## Last Week's Accomplishments

Identified how to document changes between stages in a project - implementing something very similar to Git diff structure: noting the specific line number below which code is either added or removed, displaying the number of lines that were added/removed/modified, and the exact test of the modifications that were made.

## This Week's Plan

Create a script that can parse the log files that will be generated, and identify which lines the student needs to modify in order to progress to the next stage. Ideally, we can figure out more specifics about code that needs to be added/modified, such as loops or i/else logic, and export the information in a way that can allow administrators to write up instructions that can guide the student towards the next change.

## Anything Blocking?

Need to figure out how to identify what a snippet of code is doing, or at least obtain enough of an idea to be able to provide guidance to a student about what needs to be implemented.
